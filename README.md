# PZ_WMS
This mod intends to add a Warehouse Management System to PZ

# General idea:

- By adding 2 scrap electronics to a Large Metal Shelves, it's converted to a WMS Shelf, where you can them assign a custom adress to it;
- The idea is to connect all WMS Shelves inside a structure to a network, and display the total storage of that network on a computer;
- The player should be able to search an item and return the adresses where he can find it or he can select the adress and check what it contains.
