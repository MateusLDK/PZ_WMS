# PZ_WMS
This mod intends to add a Warehouse Management System to PZ

# General idea:

- when 2 scrap electronics are added to a Large Metal Shelves, it' converted to a WMS Shelf, where you can them assign a custom adress to it;
- The idea is to connect all WMS Shelves inside a structure to a network, and display the total storage of that network on a computer;
- The player should be able to search for an item and the computer would return all the adresses where he can find it or, he can select an adress and the computer would display what it contains.
- The shelves themselves should require power to operate since they have electronics, and the computer should have a greater consumption when ON.
